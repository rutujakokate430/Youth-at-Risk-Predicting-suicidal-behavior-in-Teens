# Predicting Youth Suicidality Using Data Science

## Overview
Youth suicidality is a pressing public health concern, with alarming increases in suicidal thoughts and behaviors among teenagers over the past decade. Our project aims to provide actionable insights into identifying at-risk youths using advanced data mining and machine learning techniques. By leveraging the **Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)** 2021 dataset, this project highlights key behavioral, demographic, and emotional indicators of suicide risk to aid early intervention strategies.

## Motivation
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports a 52.2% increase in youth suicides between 2000 and 2021. Suicide remains the second leading cause of death among individuals aged 10â€“24. With over 224,000 emergency department visits annually for self-harm in youth, there is a critical need for proactive identification and support systems. This project provides a data-driven approach to addressing this crisis.

## Dataset
- **Source**: YRBSS dataset (2021), CDC  
- **Size**: 17,232 respondents, 109 survey questions  
- **Target Variable**: Binary response to "During the past 12 months, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?"  
- **Features**: Demographic, behavioral, and emotional indicators.

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Data**:  
   - Columns with >40% missing values were excluded.  
   - KNN-based imputation for continuous features (e.g., height, weight).  

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Combined related columns into meaningful composites (e.g., "Tobacco Products Usage").  
   - Introduced calculated features like BMI and categorized it into four groups: Underweight, Healthy Weight, Overweight, and Obese.

3. **Scaling and Encoding**:  
   - Min-max scaling for continuous features.  
   - One-hot encoding for categorical features, resulting in 301 encoded variables.

## Methodology
We employed statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and build predictive models:

1. **Statistical Analysis**:  
   - **T-tests** for continuous variables (e.g., height, weight, BMI) showed significant differences linked to suicidality.  
   - **Chi-square tests** for categorical variables quantified relationships between features (e.g., gender, race) and the target variable.  
   - **Cramer's V** measured the strength of these associations.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model with good interpretability.  
   - **Random Forest**: Identified top predictors of suicide risk and achieved high recall.  
   - **XGBoost**: Provided the best accuracy (85%) and robust AUC scores (0.90), excelling in identifying true positives.

3. **Feature Importance**:  
   - Emotional indicators such as "Felt Sad or Hopeless" emerged as the strongest predictors.  
   - Social factors (e.g., bullying, sexual identity) also played significant roles.

## Results and Key Findings
1. **Demographic Insights**:  
   - LGBTQ+ youth showed disproportionately higher risk levels, with bisexual respondents being the most vulnerable group.  
   - Females were twice as likely as males to consider suicide.

2. **Behavioral Patterns**:  
   - Electronic bullying victims had a 2x higher suicide risk.  
   - Substance use (e.g., tobacco, marijuana) correlated with elevated risk levels.

3. **Emotional Health**:  
   - Respondents reporting poor mental health "always" were at the highest risk.

## Practical Applications
- **Risk Scoring**:  
   A calculated "Suicide Risk Score" categorizes individuals into five actionable risk groups (Very High Risk, High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, No Risk).

- **Community Impact**:  
   - Helps educators and counselors prioritize resources.  
   - Enables data-driven preventive interventions for at-risk students.

## Challenges
- Balancing data sensitivity with imputation techniques.  
- Managing class imbalance without compromising survey integrity.  
- Ensuring models generalize effectively across diverse populations.
